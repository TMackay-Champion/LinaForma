LinaForma is a series of MATLAB® scripts for calculating the optimal pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions experienced by a rock using a grid-search inversion, accompanied by bootstrap re-sampling to quantify the solution uncertainty and sensitivity to the input variables. LinaForma calculates the difference ("misfit") between measurements (e.g., Xalm) and forward models computed for a range of P-T points in third-party software such as [THERIAK-DOMINO](https://titan.minpet.unibas.ch/minpet/theriak/prog11032020/), [Perple_X](https://www.perplex.ethz.ch/), and [MageMIN](https://github.com/ComputationalThermodynamics/MAGEMin). The P-T point with the lowest misfit value defines the “best-fit” solution. A suite of tools is also provided for plotting forward model data, performing tasks such as Principal Component Analysis, and automating relevant processes in THERIAK-DOMINO. 

LinaForma requires no prior computer programming knowledge and a step-by-step walkthrough is provided.

Key Features
-------
To use these codes, please either download them as a ZIP file or 

There are three key packages:
1) **LinaForma_inversion**: this package performs a grid-search inversion to quantify which P-T conditions best fit the rock of interest. Bootstrap re-sampling provides an assessment of the uncertainty associated with this P-T estimate, and the sensitivity of the estimate to uncertainty in the input variables.
2) **TheriakDomino_tools**: this package provides useful tools for creating bulk-composition THERIN files (E1 script), collating DOMINO output into a single csv. file (E2), automating THERIAK (E3), plotting data in heatmaps, contour plots etc. (E4), and calculating the correlation coefficients between the different variables, temperature and pressure (E5).
3) **PCA_phase_composition**: this package allows the user to perform Principal Component Analysis and K-means clustering on mineral composition data.
