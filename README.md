# LinaForma
This code performs a grid-search to examine best P-T solutions...blah blah blah
There are three key packages:
1) EXTRA_TD_tools: here we provide useful tools for plotting data from THERIAK-DOMINO, creating bulk-composition THERIN files, and automating THERIAK.
2) LineForma_inversion: here we perform a grid-search inversion to quantify which pressure-temperature conditions best fitn your rock.
3) PCA_mineral_composition: here you can perform Principal Component Analysis and K-means clustering on mineral composition data to examine whether there are multiple populations.
