## Overview
These five codes perform a grid-search inversion, accompanied by bootstrap re-sampling, to determine which Pressure-Temperature (P-T) conditions best fit the rock of interest. The bootstrap re-sampling allows the user to determine the uncertainty in this result, as well as the sensitivity of the result to the uncertainty of the input parameters. An example of the ouputs can be found in [EXAMPLES](https://github.com/TMackay-Champion/LinaForma/tree/8486dc1820e7d5363f01476148a69ec186ac12be/EXAMPLES).

## Data Inputs
All of the codes require the same two inputs:
1) **forward_model.csv** = this CSV file contains the forward models for selected parameters (e.g., XMg in biotite, vol% garnet) created in software like THERIAK-DOMINO. These files can be created using scripts E2 or E3 (see [TheriakDomino_tools](https://github.com/TMackay-Champion/LinaForma/tree/8486dc1820e7d5363f01476148a69ec186ac12be/TheriakDomino_tools)). The codes use the same input format as script E4.
2) **measurements.csv** = this CSV file contains the measured values matching each of the parameters in the forward model file. It is important that the measurements are in the order given the the forward model file. There are two accepted formats for this file: A) list all the measurements for each parameter. These may be individual point measurements for example (e.g., [InputA](https://github.com/TMackay-Champion/LinaForma/blob/fc10a0389be120343103fd7d5d064678d722b435/EXAMPLES/InputA.csv). B) provide the mean and standard deviation of each parameter (e.g., [InputB]). 


## L0_isopleths.m
This code allows the user to ascertain which regions in P-T space coincide with the observed values for each parameter of interest. Zones of intersecting isopleths will be plotted.

**sd = ?**\

**all1 = ?**\
% Do you want to plot all of the variables? 1 = YES, 0 = NO.\

<summary> L0 script output </summary>
 
The code outputs three figures: 
1) **Percentage overlap**. This plot shows the regions in P-T space which have the greatest percentage of overlapping parameters. 
2) **Isopleths**. This plot shows which regions in P-T space coincide with the observed values for each parameter of interest. Different parameters are ascribed different colours.
3) **Overlapping contours**. This plot shows the contours for each parameter and the overlapping areas in P-T space for the measured values.

## L1_error.m
No two measurements will be exactly the same. This script allows the user to assess the uncertainty in P-T estimate for each variable, based on the variation in observations. This variation may be caused by analytical or geological processes.

**n = ?**\
This is only applicable if raw = 0. It controls the number of random samples taken from the distribution of each variable (it assumes a normal distrubtion, created using the input mean and standard deviation).
</details>

<details>
<summary> L1 script output </summary>
 
The code outputs two figures: 
1) a boxplot for each variable showing how temperature estimates vary based on the range of measured values.
2) a boxplot for each variable showing how pressure estimates vary based on the range of measured values.
</details>


## L2_inversion.m
This code performs a bootstrap re-sampling of the observation data, and a grid-search inversion to find the best-fit solution for each bootstrap resample. These are combined to give the user a best-fit pressure-temperature estimate and associated uncertainty for the system of interest. 

The grid-search inversion works by calculating the misfit between the observed data and the forward model at each P-T point in the forward model CSV file dataset. The best-fit solution is the P-T point with the lowest misfit value. It is important that the grid spacing is dense enough to ensure the minimum misfit is not missed between the grid spaces.

## L3_residuals.m
This script allows the user to examine the difference between the forward model predicitions and the observed data at chosen P-T points.
This can be used to check how well different variables match the best-fit solution. When accompanied by textural evidence or large enough datasets, this process could be used to examine disequilibrium and/or model error.

## L4_sensitivity.m
This script examines how sensitive the best-fit solutions are to uncertainty in the observations. To do this, the code bootstrap re-samples one variable at a time while keeping all the other variables constant. The resulting variation in the best-fit solutions can then be directly attritubted to the uncertainty on that particular variable.

## FAQs
<details>
<summary> How many input variables should I use? </summary>
A grid-search is a non-linear inversion. The problem is overdetermined because the number of observations is in excess of of the number of model parameters. 
Each data point provides a constraint on the possible solution. By incorporating multiple constraints, overdetermined problems can identify and compensate for errors in the different variables.
This often results in a higher precision estimate than could be achieved by the individual variables alone. 

This is important when considering correlated variables. In an error-free system, it would be reasonable to remove all correlated variables. However, each variable in a petrological system is associated with a different level of error and the primary cause of this error will vary between different variables. 
One can readily imagine a situation in which two highly correlated variables result in different P-T estimates due to petrological or model error. Considering the two variables together allows the user to determine the most appropriate solution.
As such, we deem it acceptable to use variables which are predicted to be highly correlated in the forward model. 
However, phases which are common to one mineral should only be used together if a degree of freedom remains. For example, e.g., the composition of plagioclase can be described by Xan and Xab. You should only use 1 of these variables, to maintain a degree of freedom.

<details>
 <summary> What are the different types of bootstrap re-sampling method? </summary>
Bootstrap resampling refers to random re-sampling of the original dataset, with replacement. This re-sampling is used to examine the uncertainty of the best-fit solution. Uncertainty may be introduced through model error, mesasurement error, disequilibrium and other such processes. 
Using bootstrapping, we can examine the effects of these errors on our P-T solution. The codes allow three different styles of re-sampling for each variable in turn:
1) Parametric bootstrapping (option 1): this assumes that the data follow a specific parametric distribution, such as the normal distribution. 
Bootstrap samples are chosen by randomly drawing observations from the assumed distribution with replacement. The LinaForma code assumes a normal distribtuion, and calculates an appropriate mean and standard deviation from the data given in observations.csv.
2) Non-parametric bootstrapping (option 0): this option re-samples the original data mulitple times and calculates the mean from each re-sampling. These mean values are used in the grid-search.
3) "Synthetic bootstrapping" (option -1): in this option, the code lets the user decide on an appropriate mean and standard deviation for a Gaussian parametric bootstrap using the "synthetic.csv" file.
</details>


<details>
<summary> What bootstrapping method should I use? </summary>
 
The method of bootstrapping depends on your assumptions surrounding the sources of error in the system.
Non-parametric bootstrapping assumes that the underlying model generating the data is unknown or too complex to be accurately represented by a parametric distribution. 
Instead of making explicit assumptions about the model, non-parametric bootstrapping focuses solely on the observed data and its properties. This error can be examinied for each variable using the L1_error.m script (Part 1).
As such, we deem this bootstrap method to be most appropriate if we assume that the primary source of error is analytical and/or related to disequilbrium, geological uncertainty etc. 
In this case, the error associated with the observations is greater than associated model error. 

However, in some cases the primary source of error may be model error. In this case, the synthetic bootstrap option may be most suitable as it allows the user to select an appropriate mean and standard deviation. 
A standard deviation should be chosen which allows for a suitable degree of temperature and pressure uncertainty for the particular variable of interest. This can be chosen with the help of the L1_error.m script (Part 2).
We have generally found that a standard deviation equivalent to 20% of the mean value is more than enough.
