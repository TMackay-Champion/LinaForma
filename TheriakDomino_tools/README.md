# Theriak Domino tools
These packages provide useful tools for modelling and plotting petrological data. Scripts E2 and E3 are specific to the program THERIAK-DOMINO. E1, E4 and E5 can be used for any forward modelling program as the required code inputs are CSV files.

## E1 composition calculator
This code allows the user to create a composition file (THERIN.txt) for TD from original weight percent oxide bulk compositions.

## E2 collate DOMINO
This code allows the user to collate the outputs of DOMINO (a folder containing many text files) into a CSV file containing all the information in P-T order.

## E3 loop THERIAK
This code allows the user to run THERIAK in a loop and save the results to a CSV file.

## E4 plotter
This code allows the user to plot the outputs of DOMINO, THERIAK or any other forward modelling software. There are options for contour maps, heatmaps, field stability boundaries, variance, etc.

## E5 correlation
This code allows the user to calculate the correlation coefficient between each variable, temperature and pressure.
