# E4_plotter
These two codes provide tools for plotting data from any CSV file, including those created for THERIAK-DOMINO in scripts E2 and E3. The X axis values must be given in the first column, the Y axis values must be given in the second column. If you have used the scripts E2 or E3, the CSV files will already be in the correct format.

## Inputs
Both of the codes require input data in the form of a CSV file. An example can be seen below:

## E1 composition calculator
This code allows the user to create a composition file (THERIN.txt) for TD from original weight percent oxide bulk compositions.

## E2 collate DOMINO
This code allows the user to collate the outputs of DOMINO (a folder containing many text files) into a CSV file containing all the information in P-T order.
 E3 loop THERIAKthe user to run THERIAK in a loop and save the results to a CSV file.

## E4 plotter
This code allows the user to plot the outputs of DOMINO, THERIAK or any other forward modelling software. There are options for contour maps, heatmaps, field stability boundaries, variance, etc.
