# E1_comp
This code allows the user to create a composition file (THERIN.txt) for TD from the original oxide weight percent compositions. The output is element proportions, and can be readily used in Perple_X sofware.

## Inputs
1) input_comp.csv. This file should contain the bulk composition of the sample in oxide weight percent. Please do not change the order of the oxides.

## Code
1) composition = '???'. This should be the name of the input file containing the bulk composition information (e.g., "input_comp.csv").

2) sample_name = '???'. Give your sample a name!

3) TD_output = '?'. This controls the output of THERIAK-DOMINO (see the program documentation for more detail).

## Outputs
The code will output a therin.txt file which looks like this:
