# E5_correlation.m
This code allows the user to calculate the correlation coefficient between each variable, temperature and pressure.
The correlation coefficient is calculated using the corrcoef function of MATLAB.

## Inputs
Both of the codes require input data in the form of a CSV file. The X axis values must be given in the first column, the Y axis values must be given in the second column. If you have used the scripts E2 or E3, the CSV files will already be in the correct format. 

## Outputs
The code outputs a spreadsheet called 'correlation_coefficients.csv' which displays the correlation coefficient between each variable, T and P.
